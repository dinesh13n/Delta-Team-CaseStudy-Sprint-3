**[M]** measured in the fixture (dataset-declared, synthetic), **[ASM]** assumption, **[UNK]** unknown. This pack does not decide that AI is justified; that is Stage E.

- [M] The prompt today is one record serialised with `str.format`; largest observed declared total is 4,989 tokens.
- Provisional constraints [ASM]: context window used per request <= 8,000 tokens; record payload <= 2,000 tokens; no free-text fields from untrusted sources included without sanitising (supports Stage J guardrails).
- [UNK] Whether prior-record history or retrieval would be added; none in code.
- [UNK] Maximum context of the chosen model (OQ-02).
