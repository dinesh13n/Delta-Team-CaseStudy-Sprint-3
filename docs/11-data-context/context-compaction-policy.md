Classification: **[VF]** Verified Fact, **[INF]** Inference, **[ASM]** Assumption, **[UNK]** Unknown.

Single-shipment context is small; compaction applies only to the event list: keep the last 10 events plus all events of type exception, then collapse older ones into counts by type. Never drop an event referenced by a rule violation. Compaction is deterministic and logged (counts dropped). No LLM summarisation of context.
